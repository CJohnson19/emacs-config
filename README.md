# Emacs Configuration

Personal [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration files.
This is a literate configuration, and as such most of the information is in `config.org`.

Running `doom sync` will tangle `src` blocks in `config.org` to the actual configuration.
Doom's built-in package system is defined in `init.el`.
