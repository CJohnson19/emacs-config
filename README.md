# Emacs Configuration

Personal [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration
files. This is a literate configuration, and as such most of the information is 
in `config.org`.

Running `doom sync` will tangle `src` blocks in `config.org` to the actual
configuration. Doom's built-in package system is defined in `init.el`.

A beginner's cautionary tale: using Github to read the `config.org` will obscure
much of the important information. Consider viewing the raw file.
